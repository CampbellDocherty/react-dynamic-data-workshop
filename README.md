# React with dynamic data workshop for Founders & Coders

The purpose of this workshop is to understand the most common usecase for React in modern frontend.
That usecase is fetching some data from an API and then rendering it.

For this workshop we'll use the GitHub API since it's well documented and familiar to most students.

## Set up

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sofiapoh/react-dynamic-data-workshop.git

cd react-dynamic-data-workshop

npm i

#and finally

npm start
```

You should now see the following message:

```
Server running at http://localhost:1234
âœ¨  Built in 1.22s.
```

If you do not see this message make sure you have the latest version of node (and npm) installed.
